# M365typos
A place to track typos found in Microsoft 365 services, incorrect logos, etc.

The rules are simple:
1. Check the issues list to see if one already exists
2. If there's existing issue, create one
3. Provide URLs and/or screenshots to support your issue (and highlight the area)
4. Be professional and respectful - there are humans on the other side of this
5. The purpose of this repo is to help, not complain

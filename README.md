## Update, and why I archived the repo
Not long after I created this repo, I stopped updating it for a couple of main reasons:
- There were not always places for feedback to be logged on via Microsoft feedback mechanisms
- I kept finding more and more errors and issues in my daily travels through M365

While I thought originally creating this would be helpful to get the issues resolved, overall it actually became disheartening to see so many errors. We can accept that the platform is big and there are many people involved, but it shouldn't fall to end customers & users to point these out.


# Microsoft 365 Errors
A place to track typos and incorrect logos found in Microsoft 365 services.

The rules are simple:
1. If it's just a text issue on docs.microsoft.com and you can edit the page - go right ahead and do that, no need to create an issue here if you can fix it yourself!
2. Check the existing issues list to see if one already exists.
3. If there's no existing issue, you're welcome to create one.
4. Provide URLs and/or screenshots to support your issue (and highlight the area).
5. Be professional and respectful - there are humans on the other side of this.
6. The purpose of this repo is to help, not complain.

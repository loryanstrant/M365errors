# Microsoft 365 Errors
A place to track typos and incorrect logos found in Microsoft 365 services.

The rules are simple:
1. If it's just a text issue on docs.microsoft.com and you can edit the page - go right ahead and do that, no need to create an issue here if you can fix it yourself!
2. Check the existing issues list to see if one already exists.
3. If there's no existing issue, you're welcome to create one.
4. Provide URLs and/or screenshots to support your issue (and highlight the area).
5. Be professional and respectful - there are humans on the other side of this.
6. The purpose of this repo is to help, not complain.
